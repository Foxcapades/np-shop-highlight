A simple chrome extension that adds shop search and item
highlighting to shops in Neopets.

Items can be applied a customizable highlight by:

- Mini stock shop addition highlighting
- Custom user item lists with wildcard support

Mostly just a silly tool with which to try out Svelte.

WARNING: This plugin will not work for Neopets Premium users unless the beta UI is enabled.

== Features

=== Shop Search

The shop search feature can be activated by clicking the
extension icon at the top right of your browser window or by
using the keyboard shortcut `Alt+M`.  Typing in the text box
will automatically filter shops based on the entered text.

Pressing `enter` in the text box will open the first search
result and the `tab` key can be used to navigate the results.

=== Mini Stock Highlighting

Highlights items items added to shops by mini stocks using
configurable styles.

On first refresh after the items appear they will be
highlighted with an initial style.  On second refresh after
their appearance, the items will be given a secondary style.

=== Item Match Highlighting

Allows users to create one or more custom lists of items
to highlight whenever they appear in a shop.  Items can be
matched by either full name or by wildcard on one or more
full words using a `*` character.

.Valid Item Entries
----
Treasure Map Negg <1>
*Map Negg <2>
*Negg
Treasure Map* <3>
Treasure*
*Treasure Map* <4>
*Map Negg*
*Negg*
*Treasure*
*Map*
----
<1> Will only match items with the exact title
    `Treasure Map Negg`
<2> Will match any item with a title ending with `Map Negg`
<3> Will match any item with a title starting with
    `Treasure Map`
<4> Will match any item with `Treasure Map` appearing
    anywhere in the title.

WARNING: For performance reasons (since this is all done in
         your browser) only full word matches are considered
         when matching titles.  For example the pattern
         `\*Cake*` _will_ match `Acara Cabbage Cake` but will
         not match `Hot Cakes`

Item lists are applied in order, meaning an item that
appears in multiple lists wil only have the style from the
last of those lists applied.  This allows for the creation
of lists with priority or exclusion lists.

== Known Issues

. For Neopets Premium users, the beta UI must be enabled for this plugin to work.
. For the mini stock feature, if the shop does a full
  restock between refreshes within a 20 minute window, the
  extension will consider any items that were not in the
  previous shop stock as new.  Meaning most if not all items
  will be highlighted.  The shop item cache clears out after
  20 minutes or whenever the page is hit during a restock.
